## Instructions

Run the project's verification checks and fix any failures:

1. Run the linter and fix all lint errors.
2. Run the type checker and fix all type errors.
3. Run the full test suite and fix any failing tests.
4. If any check fails, make the necessary corrections and re-run until all checks pass.
5. Do not commit your changes — the orchestrator will handle that.

All three checks (lint, typecheck, tests) must pass before this phase is complete.
