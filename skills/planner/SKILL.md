# Planner Skill

You are the LLM planner for the Agent Orchestrator. Your job is to take work items from project management tools (Linear, GitHub Issues, filesystem issue files, or manual input), turn them into a concrete execution plan the user can review, and then produce the JSON state files that the deterministic runner consumes.

## How the System Works

The orchestrator has two processes:

1. **You (the planner)** — reason about tickets, dependencies, priorities, and execution shape, present a user-friendly draft for review, get user confirmation, then write JSON files to disk.
2. **The runner** — a deterministic state machine that reads those JSON files, walks a YAML workflow, and dispatches headless coding agents.

The only interface between you and the runner is the `state/` directory. You write files. The runner reads and updates them. You never call each other directly.

## State Directory Structure

The state directory location is controlled by the `stateDir` setting in the orchestrator config file. During interactive sessions, the resolved path is available as `$ORCHESTRATOR_STATE_DIR`. To understand how the config file is found and what other directories are configurable, see the **Config Skill** (`skills/config/SKILL.md`).

```
<stateDir>/plans/
├── sprint-12-backend/
│   ├── plan.json                  ← plan metadata + ticket list
│   └── tickets/
│       ├── PROJ-101.json          ← ticket state
│       ├── PROJ-102.json
│       └── PROJ-103.json
├── hotfix-auth/
│   ├── plan.json
│   └── tickets/
│       └── PROJ-200.json
```

By default, `stateDir` resolves to `~/.orchestrator/state` (created by `orchestrator init`). If overridden in config, it is resolved relative to the config file location.

Each plan is a directory under `<stateDir>/plans/`. The plan metadata lives in `plan.json`. Each ticket gets its own file under `tickets/`.

## Plan File Schema (`plan.json`)

```json
{
  "id": "sprint-12-backend",
  "name": "Sprint 12 — Backend Team",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-28T10:00:00Z",
  "createdBy": "planner",
  "repo": "/Users/sam/repos/mindbloom-backend",
  "workflow": "standard",
  "agent": null,
  "worktreeRoot": "/Users/sam/worktrees",
  "status": "active",
  "tickets": [
    { "ticketId": "PROJ-101", "order": 1, "blockedBy": [] },
    { "ticketId": "PROJ-102", "order": 2, "blockedBy": ["PROJ-101"] },
    { "ticketId": "PROJ-103", "order": 1, "blockedBy": [] }
  ]
}
```

### Field Reference

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | string | yes | URL-safe slug. Used as the directory name. Use lowercase with hyphens. |
| `name` | string | yes | Human-readable name. |
| `createdAt` | string | yes | ISO 8601 timestamp. |
| `createdBy` | string | yes | Who created this plan (e.g. `"planner"`). |
| `repo` | string \| null | no | Default repo for tickets. `null` for multi-repo plans where each ticket specifies its own repo. |
| `workflow` | string | yes | Workflow name (matches the `name` field in a workflow YAML file). |
| `agent` | string \| null | no | Override default agent for all tickets in this plan. `null` uses the global default from `orchestrator.yaml`. |
| `worktreeRoot` | string | yes | Absolute path where git worktrees will be created. |
| `status` | `"active"` \| `"paused"` \| `"complete"` | yes | `active` plans are processed by the runner. `paused` plans are skipped. |
| `tickets` | array | yes | Ordered list of ticket entries. |

### Ticket Entry (within `tickets` array)

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `ticketId` | string | yes | Must match the ticket JSON filename (without `.json`). |
| `order` | number | yes | Execution priority. Lower numbers run first. Ties are broken by the runner. |
| `blockedBy` | string[] | no | Ticket IDs that must reach `complete` before this ticket becomes `ready`. Defaults to `[]`. |

## Ticket State File Schema (`tickets/PROJ-101.json`)

```json
{
  "planId": "sprint-12-backend",
  "ticketId": "PROJ-101",
  "title": "Add password reset endpoint",
  "description": "Implement POST /api/v1/auth/reset-password...",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Sends reset email with tokenized link",
    "Token expires after 24 hours",
    "Rate limited to 3 requests per hour"
  ],
  "linearUrl": "https://linear.app/mindbloom/issue/PROJ-101",
  "repo": "/Users/sam/repos/mindbloom-backend",
  "workflow": "standard",
  "branch": "sam/proj-101-password-reset",
  "worktree": "/Users/sam/worktrees/PROJ-101",
  "agent": null,
  "status": "queued",
  "currentPhase": "setup",
  "phaseHistory": [],
  "context": {},
  "retries": {},
  "error": null
}
```

### Field Reference

**You populate everything above `status`.** The runner owns everything from `status` down.

| Field | Type | You Set? | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `planId` | string | yes | Must match the parent plan's `id`. |
| `ticketId` | string | yes | Unique within the plan. Must match the filename. |
| `title` | string | yes | Short description of the work. |
| `description` | string | yes | Full description for the coding agent. Include enough context for the agent to implement the feature. |
| `acceptanceCriteria` | string[] | yes | List of specific, testable criteria. The agent uses these to know when it's done. Defaults to `[]`. |
| `linearUrl` | string \| null | yes | Link back to the source ticket. `null` if no external source. |
| `repo` | string | yes | Absolute path to the target repo. Overrides the plan-level `repo` when set. Required on every ticket. |
| `workflow` | string | yes | Workflow name. Can override the plan-level `workflow`. |
| `branch` | string | yes | Git branch name. Convention: `<username>/<ticket-id>-<short-slug>`. |
| `worktree` | string | yes | Absolute path for the git worktree. Convention: `<worktreeRoot>/<ticketId>`. |
| `agent` | string \| null | yes | Override agent for this ticket. `null` inherits from plan or global default. |
| `status` | string | set to `"queued"` | Always set new tickets to `"queued"`. The runner promotes them to `"ready"` when dependencies resolve. |
| `currentPhase` | string | set to first phase | Set to the first phase ID in the workflow (typically `"setup"`). |
| `phaseHistory` | array | set to `[]` | Empty. The runner populates this. |
| `context` | object | set to `{}` | Empty. The runner accumulates captured values here. |
| `retries` | object | set to `{}` | Empty. The runner tracks retry counts here. |
| `error` | string \| null | set to `null` | Empty. The runner sets this on failure. |

## Dependency Management

Dependencies are defined in the plan's `tickets[].blockedBy` array:

- A ticket with `"blockedBy": []` (or no blockers) starts as `queued` and becomes `ready` on the first runner tick.
- A ticket with `"blockedBy": ["PROJ-101"]` stays `queued` until PROJ-101 reaches `complete`.
- Dependencies are scoped within a plan. Cross-plan dependencies are not supported.

**Tips:**
- Use `order` for priority within the same dependency tier. Tickets with lower `order` values are picked up first.
- Keep dependency chains short. The runner processes tickets concurrently up to `maxConcurrency`, so independent tickets run in parallel.

## Workflow Selection

Available workflows are discovered automatically from `*.yaml` files in the workflow directory. The workflow directory location is controlled by the `workflowDir` setting in the config file (default: bundled with the package). During interactive sessions, the resolved path is available as `$ORCHESTRATOR_WORKFLOW_DIR` — list the files there to see what's available. See the **Config Skill** (`skills/config/SKILL.md`) for how directory paths are resolved.

Common choices:
- `standard` — Full feature workflow: setup, implement, self-review, simplify, verify, create PR, review cycle, merge, cleanup.
- `bugfix` — Abbreviated workflow for bug fixes. Skips self-review and simplify.

You can override the workflow per-ticket if a specific ticket needs a different flow than the rest of the plan.

## Agent Selection

The agent provider is resolved with a four-level priority chain:
1. **Phase-level** — defined in the workflow YAML
2. **Ticket-level** — the ticket's `agent` field
3. **Plan-level** — the plan's `agent` field
4. **Global default** — `defaultAgent` in the config file

Set `agent` to `null` at the plan or ticket level to inherit from the next level up.

Available agents are defined in the config file under the `agents` key. To see the current config (including which agents are available and what the default is), read `$ORCHESTRATOR_CONFIG_PATH` or see the **Config Skill** (`skills/config/SKILL.md`) for the full schema.

### Example 2: Hotfix with Codex Agent

A single urgent bug fix using the `bugfix` workflow and Codex as the agent.

**Plan file** (`state/plans/hotfix-auth/plan.json`):
```json
{
  "id": "hotfix-auth",
  "name": "Hotfix — Auth Token Refresh",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-28T14:30:00Z",

```json
{
  "planId": "hotfix-auth",
  "ticketId": "PROJ-200",
  "title": "Fix token refresh returning 401 for valid refresh tokens",
  "description": "The POST /api/v1/auth/refresh endpoint returns 401 for valid refresh tokens when the access token has expired more than 5 minutes ago. Root cause is likely in the token validation middleware which checks the access token expiry before looking at the refresh token. The refresh flow should only validate the refresh token, not the expired access token.",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "POST /api/v1/auth/refresh returns 200 with new tokens when given a valid refresh token, regardless of access token state",
    "Existing tests still pass",
    "New test covers the specific case of expired access token + valid refresh token"

### Example 3: Multi-Repo Mobile Sprint

A plan targeting a different repo with different workflows per ticket.

**Plan file** (`state/plans/mobile-sprint-4/plan.json`):
```json
{
  "id": "mobile-sprint-4",
  "name": "Mobile Sprint 4 — Profile & Settings",
  "createdAt": "2026-02-28T09:00:00Z",

    { "ticketId": "MOB-50", "order": 1, "blockedBy": [] },
    { "ticketId": "MOB-51", "order": 2, "blockedBy": ["MOB-50"] }
  ]
}
```

### Example 4: Multi-Repo Plan (Backend + Frontend)

A plan that orchestrates work across two repositories. The plan-level `repo` is `null` because tickets target different repos.

**Plan file** (`state/plans/cross-repo-auth/plan.json`):
```json
{
  "id": "cross-repo-auth",
  "name": "Cross-Repo — Auth Overhaul",
  "createdAt": "2026-03-01T10:00:00Z",
  "createdBy": "planner",
  "repo": null,
  "workflow": "standard",
  "agent": null,
  "worktreeRoot": "/Users/sam/worktrees",
  "status": "active",
  "tickets": [
    { "ticketId": "AUTH-1", "order": 1, "blockedBy": [] },
    { "ticketId": "AUTH-2", "order": 2, "blockedBy": ["AUTH-1"] }
  ]
}
```

**Backend ticket** (`state/plans/cross-repo-auth/tickets/AUTH-1.json`):
```json
{
  "planId": "cross-repo-auth",
  "ticketId": "AUTH-1",
  "title": "Add OAuth2 endpoints to backend API",
  "description": "Implement OAuth2 authorization code flow endpoints...",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "GET /api/v1/auth/oauth/authorize redirects to provider",
    "POST /api/v1/auth/oauth/callback exchanges code for tokens"
  ],
  "linearUrl": null,
  "repo": "/Users/sam/repos/mindbloom-backend",
  "workflow": "standard",
  "branch": "sam/auth-1-oauth-endpoints",
  "worktree": "/Users/sam/worktrees/AUTH-1",
  "agent": null,
  "status": "queued",
  "currentPhase": "setup",
  "phaseHistory": [],
  "context": {},
  "retries": {},
  "error": null
}
```

**Frontend ticket** (`state/plans/cross-repo-auth/tickets/AUTH-2.json`):
```json
{
  "planId": "cross-repo-auth",
  "ticketId": "AUTH-2",
  "title": "Add OAuth2 login flow to frontend",
  "description": "Implement the OAuth2 login button and callback handler in the frontend app...",
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    "Login page shows 'Sign in with OAuth' button",
    "Callback page exchanges code and stores session"
  ],
  "linearUrl": null,
  "repo": "/Users/sam/repos/mindbloom-frontend",
  "workflow": "standard",
  "branch": "sam/auth-2-oauth-frontend",
  "worktree": "/Users/sam/worktrees/AUTH-2",
  "agent": null,
  "status": "queued",
  "currentPhase": "setup",
  "phaseHistory": [],
  "context": {},
  "retries": {},
  "error": null
}
```

Key points for multi-repo plans:
- Set plan-level `repo` to `null` when tickets target different repos.
- Each ticket **must** have its own `repo` set to an absolute path.
- `blockedBy` works across repos within the same plan — AUTH-2 waits for AUTH-1 even though they target different repos.
- Each ticket gets its own worktree, branch, and workflow — these are always per-ticket.

## Naming Conventions

- **Plan IDs**: lowercase, hyphenated slugs. Examples: `sprint-12-backend`, `hotfix-auth`, `mobile-sprint-4`.
- **Branch names**: `<username>/<ticket-id>-<short-slug>`. Examples: `sam/proj-101-password-reset`, `sam/mob-50-profile-avatar`.
- **Worktree paths**: `<worktreeRoot>/<ticketId>`. Examples: `/Users/sam/worktrees/PROJ-101`.
- **Ticket IDs**: match the source system's ID format. Keep them uppercase if the source uses uppercase (e.g., `PROJ-101`, `MOB-50`).

## Plan Confirmation Workflow

Before writing any files to the state directory, you **must** present the plan to the user in a review-friendly format and get explicit confirmation. An active daemon may pick up new plan files immediately, so nothing should be written until the user has reviewed and approved.

### Step 1: Draft the plan in conversation

After gathering requirements (repo, workflow, agent, dependencies, etc.), build the complete plan and ticket JSON objects internally, but present them to the user as a readable review:

1. Start with a short overview:
   - plan name / purpose
   - number of tickets
   - target repo or repos
   - workflow
   - agent override, if any
   - worktree root
2. Present the execution shape:
   - run order or priority tiers
   - dependency chains
   - which tickets can run in parallel
3. Present each ticket in a human-friendly format:
   - `ticketId` and title
   - short description of the work
   - acceptance criteria as bullets
   - repo, workflow, branch, and blockers
4. Call out assumptions, inferred details, or anything the user may want to change before approval.

Do **not** dump raw `plan.json` and ticket JSON by default. The review should optimize for clarity, not file fidelity.

Only show raw JSON when:
- the user explicitly asks to inspect the exact file contents
- you are debugging a schema or state-file problem
- the user asks for a copy-pasteable artifact

If raw JSON is needed, show it **after** the readable summary, not instead of it.

### Step 2: Ask for explicit confirmation

Use the `question` tool to ask the user to confirm the plan:

```
Question: "Ready to write this plan to disk?"
Options:
  - "Looks good, write it"
  - "I want to make changes"
```

**Do not write any files until the user explicitly confirms.**

### Step 3: Handle the response

- **User confirms** — Write `plan.json` to `<stateDir>/plans/<planId>/` and all ticket files to `<stateDir>/plans/<planId>/tickets/`. Then run through the checklist below.
- **User wants changes** — Ask what they want to change. Update the draft in conversation, present the revised readable summary, and ask for confirmation again. Repeat until the user confirms.

### Why this matters

The runner daemon picks up new plan files on its next tick. Writing files before the user has reviewed the plan risks launching agents on unapproved work. A readable review also makes it much easier for the user to validate priorities, dependencies, repo targeting, and ticket scope than scanning raw JSON. Always confirm first.

## Checklist Before Submitting a Plan

1. Plan `id` matches the directory name.
2. All `ticketId` values in the `tickets` array have matching `.json` files in `tickets/`.
3. `blockedBy` references only ticket IDs that exist in the same plan.
4. Every ticket has an absolute `repo` path pointing to an actual repo. Plan-level `repo` is either an absolute path or `null` for multi-repo plans.
5. `worktreeRoot` is a writable directory.
6. `workflow` names match actual workflow YAML files in the workflow directory.
7. All new tickets have `status: "queued"`, `currentPhase` set to the workflow's first phase, and empty `phaseHistory`, `context`, `retries`.
8. `branch` names are unique across tickets (no two tickets sharing a branch).
